Open source projects are a cornerstone of software development, offering learning resources and a platform for technological advancement and community collaboration. As a newcomer to the open source world, you might feel a bit overwhelmed about how to get involved. This guide will walk you through the process, from selecting a project to submitting your first Pull Request (PR).

## **1 How to Choose the Right Open Source Project**

**Choose Based on Your Interests and Skills**

Selecting a project that aligns with your interests is crucial because it will motivate you to keep learning and contributing. Additionally, consider your skill level and choose a project that matches your abilities. If you're just starting out, look for projects with issues labeled "good first issue" or "beginner friendly."

**Check Project Activity**

Opt for active projects where you can easily get help and support. Active projects typically have more contributors and maintainers, fostering a friendly community atmosphere.

**Useful Project Lists**

- [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore): GitHub's official project exploration page, allowing you to filter projects by popularity, trends, etc.
- [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/): A website recommending open source projects, suitable for newcomers.
- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/): A platform focused on helping new contributors get involved in open source.



## **2 Getting Familiar with the Project**

**Read the Project Documentation**

Every open source project usually has a README file containing basic project information, usage instructions, contribution guidelines, etc. Carefully read these documents to understand the project's background and development standards.

**Understand the Project Structure**

Get to know the project's directory structure and code organization. This will help you quickly locate the parts you need to modify.

**Join the Project Community**

Connect with the project community through GitHub, mailing lists, Slack, Discord, etc. This is a great way to get help and support from other contributors.



## **3 Types of Contributions You Can Make**

**Code Contributions:**

- **Fix Bugs**: Look for issues labeled "good first issue" or "beginner friendly" in the project's issue tracking system and resolve them.
- **Add New Features**: If you have good ideas, propose and implement new features. It's best to communicate with project maintainers before starting.
- **Optimize Code**: Improve existing code, such as enhancing performance or code style.

**Non-Code Contributions:**

- **Documentation Writing**: Enhance project documentation, including user guides and development docs.
- **Translation**: Provide multi-language support by translating documentation or the user interface.
- **Testing**: Participate in testing, providing test reports and feedback.
- **Community Support**: Answer questions and help solve problems in the community.



## **4 How to Create and Manage Issues**

**Preparations Before Creating an Issue:**

- **Understand the Project**: Know the project's basic functions and usage to ensure your issue is relevant.
- **Check for Existing Issues**: Search the project's existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- **Read the Contribution Guidelines**: Most projects have a CONTRIBUTING.md file with issue creation guidelines.

**Steps to Create an Issue:**

1. **Log in to GitHub**: Ensure you're logged into your GitHub account.
2. **Navigate to the Project Repository**: Find the GitHub repository of the open source project you want to contribute to.
3. **Click the "Issues" Tab**: Locate and click the "Issues" tab in the repository's top navigation bar.
4. **Click the "New Issue" Button**: Find and click the "New Issue" button in the top right corner of the Issues page.

6. **Submit the Issue**: Click the "Submit new issue" button to post your issue.



## **5 How to Submit a Pull Request (PR)**

**Fork the Project:**

On GitHub, locate the target project and click the "Fork" button to create a copy in your GitHub account.

**Clone the Project Locally:**

Use Git commands to clone the forked project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
```

**Create a Branch:**

In your local repository, create a new branch for your development work:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

**Make Your Changes:**

Modify or add code to implement your feature or fix the issue.

**Commit Your Changes:**

Save your changes to the local branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

**Push to Your Remote Repository:**

Upload your local branch to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

**Create a Pull Request:**

On GitHub, switch to your branch and click the "Compare & pull request" button. Fill in the PR description and submit it.

**Wait for Review:**

Project maintainers will review your PR and may request modifications. Address their comments until the PR is accepted.
